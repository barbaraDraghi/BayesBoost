# BayesBoost
This repository contains our developed framework to detect and correct data bias within primary healthcare data.
Three scripts are available:

1. **Functions**, contains all the functions that are needed to run the framework.
2. **LaunchBayesBoost**, contains the pipeline to execute our framework on a tabular dataset containing numerical and categorical columns.
3. **EvaluationFramework**, contains the code to run machine learning comparisons and data distribution comparisons using ggplot2. 


The code has been developed using R, and the R package bnlearn (v4.8.1) is used for all Bayesian network inference.
